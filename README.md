# Keylogger

It's a vary basic kelylogger program with python.
It basically saves all that you write anywhere in your computer alongwith the date and time of writting, it's so powerful that it will save even if you write with the help of secure keyboards.
Once if it's started it makes a new file named "keylogger.log" and saves all that the victim has written including emails and passwords and everything else.
Even if somebody tries to copy paste the data it saves that also, so we can say that it's really a useful program for getting the victim's data.
